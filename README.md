# LSTMusix
Building a creative machine with this Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network. It's trained on stringified MIDI files and reproduces the song ("FÃ¼r Elise" in this example) with various diversity-factors.

Look up the already converted and back-mapped example outputfile "LSTM_output_song.mp3" 

Mapping and Corpus will be added in the future.
